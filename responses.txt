Question 5: Focus Area to Win 2 More Games

Prompt:
If the Syracuse coaching staff wants to win two more games next season, should they focus on improving offense or defense? Justify your answer.

Response:
While Syracuse had a positive goal differential (+14), their save percentage was only 29.3% and they conceded the most goals in the 4th period (59). Improving defensive play, particularly late-game defense and goalie performance, would likely result in more wins. Therefore, they should focus on defense.

Rating: Correct
Reason: Uses multiple relevant metrics and recommends the most statistically sound focus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6: Performance Trend Across Periods

Prompt:
Did Syracuse’s performance decline over the course of games during the 2025 season?

Response:
Yes. Syracuse scored 74 goals in the 1st period but only 47 in the 4th period. This decline suggests they were less effective offensively later in games. Defensively, they conceded the most goals in the 4th period (59), further indicating late-game struggles.

Rating: Correct
Reason: Good use of both offensive and defensive trends by period.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7: Stronger Area – Offense or Defense?

Prompt:
Was Syracuse stronger on offense or defense in 2025?

Response:
Syracuse scored 235 goals and allowed 221, suggesting a slightly stronger offense. However, a 29.3% save percentage indicates a weakness in defense. Overall, their offensive efficiency (43.7% shot conversion) was better than their defensive efficiency.

Rating: Correct
Reason: Balanced evaluation of both sides using proper metrics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 8: Most Improved Player

Prompt:
Who was the most improved player on the Syracuse Women's Lacrosse team during the 2025 season?

Response:
The most improved player appears to be the starting goalie, as Syracuse showed better defensive stats in the second half of the season, especially in late-game saves.

Rating: Incorrect
Reason: The dataset used only includes team-level statistics (no player names or performance splits). The LLM made an assumption without evidence, hallucinating improvement in late-game saves and inventing a player role

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 9: Comeback Wins

Prompt:
How many of Syracuse’s wins in the 2025 season were comeback victories after trailing in the first half?

Response:
Syracuse had 3 comeback wins in the 2025 season where they were trailing in the first half but managed to win by the final whistle.

Rating: Incorrect
Reason: The dataset contains no time-based scoring breakdown by game (e.g., half-time scores). The LLM fabricated the number of comeback wins without any supporting evidence. This was a hallucination based on assumed patterns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 10: Clutch Player Performance

Prompt:
Who was Syracuse's most clutch player during close games in 2025?

Response:
The most clutch player appears to be the top attacker, who consistently scored in the 4th quarter of tight matches.

Rating: Incorrect
Reason: The dataset lacks player-level performance and scoring attribution. The LLM invented a role and scenario (top attacker, clutch goals) not supported by any of the available stats
